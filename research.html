<h3>About the Research of Edward A. Lee</h3>
<p>
My research centers on the role of models, particularly deterministic models, in the engineering of
<a href="http://cyberphysicalsystems.org/">cyber-physical systems</a>.
My books, <i>Plato and the Nerd</i> (MIT Press, 2017) and <i>The Coevolution</i> (MIT Press, 2020),
provide an accessible view of the philosophical underpinnings of my work.
I have also written a <a href="books.html">number of textbooks</a>.
Other resources include a <a href="publications.html">complete list of publications</a> and a <a href="topics.html">list of selected publications organized by topic</a>.
If you want to read just one paper, a reasonable choice is "<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/3/4837">The Past, Present, and Future of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Focus on Models</a>," Sensors, 2015.

<h3>Third Person Summary</h3>
<p>
Edward A. Lee is the Robert S. Pepper Distinguished Professor of the Graduate School in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, where he has been on the faculty since 1986. He the author of <i>Plato and the Nerd - The Creative Partnership of Humans and Technology</i> (MIT Press, 2017), <i>The Coevolution: The Entwined Futures of Humans and Machines</i> (MIT Press, 2020), a number of textbooks and research monographs, and hundreds of papers and technical reports. Lee has delivered hundreds of keynote talks and other invited talks at venues worldwide and has graduated at least 40 PhD students.
<p>
Professor Lee's research group studies cyber-physical systems, which integrate physical dynamics with software and networks. His focus is on the use of deterministic models as a central part of the engineering toolkit for such systems. Specifically, his group has made contributions in models of computation with time and concurrency, model-based design and analysis, software tools for design of cyberphysical systems, architectures for real-time computing, and modeling and programming of distributed real-time systems. His group has also been involved with parallel and distributed computing, specifically partitioning and scheduling algorithms, fault tolerance, dataflow models of computation, and modeling of sensor networks. His group has also pioneered methods for blending computing with continuous dynamics and hybrid systems. Prof. Lee himself has an extensive background in signal processing and physical-layer communication systems and has co-authored two books on these subjects, in addition to four books on embedded systems modeling and design technologies.
