<h1> Information for Prospective Visitors and/or Interns </h1>
<p>
If you are interested in a visiting faculty, scholar, or student position, or an
intern position at Berkeley to work in the research group of Prof.
Edward A. Lee, please read on.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, office space is very limited at Berkeley, so we are able to accept
only very few visitors.
Almost all requests for visiting positions will be turned down.
Also, please recognize that <i>all</i> visiting positions cost us both money
(several thousand dollars in fees) and, more importantly, time.
There is no such thing as a "free" position.
<ul>
<li> <b>Internships:</b>
Prof. Lee unfortunately does not have the capacity to host intern
positions, paid or not, summer or academic year.
<li> <b>Postdocs:</b>
An extremely limited number of postdoc positions occasionally open up.
Feel free to contact Prof. Lee, but recognize that only extremely good matches in
research will be considered, and then only if there is an opening, which is rare.
<li> <b>Visiting faculty and visiting scholars:</b>
Persons with faculty positions at peer institutions or Ph.D.s with research positions
may be considered for visiting faculty or visiting scholar positions.
However, space is very limited, so we can accept only very few such visitors.
If there is an extremely good match of research interests and activities, please feel
free to contact us.
<li> <b>Volunteers and informal collaborators:</b> Unfortunately, we do not have
capacity (time and bandwidth) to engage with offsite volunteers and collaborators
except in very rare circumstances. Such collaborations almost always start with
an extended onsite visit under one or more of the mechanisms above.
</ul>
</p><p>
If you are still reading and believe that a visiting position might
still be a possibility, please consult the <a href="http://vspa.berkeley.edu/">Visiting
Scholars and Postdoc Affairs</a> office for logistical information.
I wish you the best of luck finding something suitable.
