See <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-86144-5">open access published version</a> and <a href="https://caiml.org/dighum/perspectives-on-digital-humanism-persian-translation/">Persian translation</a>.

This open access book aims to set an agenda for research and action in the field of
Digital Humanism through short essays written by selected thinkers from a variety
of disciplines, including computer science, philosophy, education, law, economics,
history, anthropology, political science, and sociology. This initiative emerged from the
Vienna Manifesto on Digital Humanism and the associated lecture series.
Digital Humanism deals with the complex relationships between people and machines
in digital times. It acknowledges the potential of information technology. At the same
time, it points to societal threats such as privacy violations and ethical concerns around
artificial intelligence, automation and loss of jobs, ongoing monopolization on the Web,
and sovereignty. Digital Humanism aims to address these topics with a sense of urgency
but with a constructive mindset. The book argues for a Digital Humanism that analyses
and, most importantly, influences the complex interplay of technology and humankind
toward a better society and life while fully respecting universal human rights. It is a call
to shaping technologies in accordance with human values and needs.<br>

This book argues that we are less in control of the trajectory of technology than we think. Technology shapes us as much as we shape it, and it may be more defensible to think of technology as the result of a Darwinian coevolution than the result of top-down intelligent design. To understand this interpretation requires a deep dive into how humans are different from computers, how evolution works, and how technology development today resembles the emergence of a new life form on our planet.

<br>
This book explores how engineers use models. Lee argues that these models are not discovered preexisting truths, but rather are invented in a fundamentally human creative process. But there are limits. Lee contests the runaway enthusiasm of technology boosters who claim that everything is computation&mdash;that even such complex phenomena as human cognition are software operating on digital data. In this view, humans become superfluous. But instead of being displaced by technology, humans are coevolving with it as it complements our cognitive and physical capabilities.

<br>
<br>
This book strives to identify and introduce the durable intellectual ideas of embedded systems as a technology and as a subject of study. The emphasis is on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which integrate computing, networking, and physical processes.
The book is intended for students at the advanced undergraduate level or the introductory graduate level, and for practicing engineers and computer scientists who wish to understand the engineering principles of embedded systems.

This book is a definitive introduction to models of computation for the design of complex, heterogeneous systems. It has a particular focus on cyber-physical systems, which integrate computing, networking, and physical dynamics. The book captures more than twenty years of experience in the Ptolemy Project at UC Berkeley, which pioneered many design, modeling, and simulation techniques that are now in widespread use. All of the methods covered in the book are realized in the open source Ptolemy II modeling framework and are available for experimentation through links provided in the book.

        This book provides an accessible introduction to signals and systems for 
        electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science students, 
        and is based on several years of successful classroom use at the University 
        of California, Berkeley. The material starts with an early introduction 
        to applications, well before students have built up enough theory to fully 
        analyze the applications. This motivates students to learn the theory 
        and allows students to master signals and systems at the sophomore level. 
        The material motivates signals and systems through sound and images, as 
        opposed to circuits, and as such calculus is the only prerequisite. </p>

      <br>
      This book is intended for designers and would-be designers of digital communication 
      systems. The general approach of the book is to extract the common principles 
      underlying a range of media and applications and present them in a unified 
      framework. Specifically, we treat the transport of bit streams from one 
      geographical location to another over various physical media, such as wire 
      pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, and radio. We also treat multiple-access 
      channels, where there are potentially multiple transmitters and receivers 
      sharing a common medium. .

S. S. Bhattacharyya, P. K. Murthy, and E. A. Lee,
<cite>Software Synthesis from Dataflow Graphs</cite>
Kluwer Academic Press, 1996.
<br>
<br>
This book studies the problem of synthesizing software
for embedded signal processing systems starting from applications
expressed as synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs.
After a comprehensive review of the theory behind SDF,
techniques are given to optimize primarily
the program memory size and secondarily the data memory size.
To accomplish this, SDF graphs describing multirate signal
processing applications are scheduled into nested loops.
A formal theory for constructing and manipulating these loops is developed,
and a class of looping structures, called single appearance schedules,
is shown to be the most efficient with respect to code size.
The existence of such structures is studied, and algorithms
for optimally constructing them are given.
Extensive experimental data is presented,
demonstrating the efficacy of the techniques.

Features</a></cite>,
IEEE Press, New York, 1997. 
<br>
<br>
This book describes key aspects of DSP processor architectures including
numeric formats, data paths, memory structures, instruction sets,
execution control, and pipelining. It also covers features found on
today's highly integrated DSPs, such as on-chip peripherals,
on-chip debugging facilities, and clocking options.
Additionally, the book discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of various types of DSP hardware and software development tools. 
Commercially available DSP processors are used as examples.
The book is intended for design engineers, engineering managers, marketing
managers, DSP and microprocessor architects, and students of architecture.

design of local and metropolitan area data networks,
voice and video telephony systems,
digital CATV distribution,
digital cellular and radio systems,
