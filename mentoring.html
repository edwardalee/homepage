<h1>Mentoring Task Force Resources</h1>

<h2>Our Charge</h2>
The Task Force on Mentoring will address the following questions 1. Identify indicators suggesting opportunity for mentoring to improve faculty job satisfaction and performance (e.g., size of advisee group, publication rate or significance, funding level or source, personal sense of fulfillment, alignment with life goals) and gauge standing in non-threatening manner. 2. Propose departmental efforts to address mentoring opportunities. 3. Propose near term and long term assessment plan.
<p>
Charge has subsequently been expanded by the chairs to include graduate students rather than just faculty.
