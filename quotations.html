<h2>On innovation</h2>
<p>
"We must not forget that the wheel is reinvented so often
because it is a very good idea; I've learned to worry more
about the soundness of ideas that were invented only once."
<p>
-- David Lorge Parnas (Computer, 2/96).

<h2>On damaging effects of a new technology: writing</h2>
<p>
"It will produce forgetfulness in the souls of those who have learned
it, through lack of practice at using their memory, as through reliance
on writing they are reminded from outside by alien marks, not from
inside, themselves by themselves: you have discovered an elixir not
of memory but of reminding.  To your students you give the appearance
of wisdom, not the reality of it; having heard much, in the absence of
teaching, they will appear to know much when for the most part they
know nothing, and they will be difficult to get along with, because
they have acquired the appearance of wisdom instead of wisdom itself."

<h2>On determinism (before anyone knew about chaos)</h2>
<p>
"We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its
past and the cause of its future.  An intellect that at any given
moment knew all the forces that animate nature and the mutual
positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast
enough to submit its data to analysis, could condense into a single
formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe
and that of the lightest atoms; for such an intellect nothing could
be uncertain; and the future, just like the past, would be present
before its eyes."

<h2>A justification for the patent system</h2>
<p>
"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all
others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking
power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively
possess as long as he keeps it to himself;  But the moment it
is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone,
and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.  Its peculiar
character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because
every other possesses the whole of it.  He who receives an
idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening
mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light with-
out darkening me.  That ideas should freely spread from one
to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual
instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,
seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by
nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all
space, without lessening their density at any point, and like
the air in which we breath, move, and have our physical
being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.
Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property."
<p>
