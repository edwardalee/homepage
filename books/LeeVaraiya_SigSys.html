        This book provides an accessible introduction to signals and systems for 
        electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science students, 
        and is based on several years of successful classroom use at the University 
        of California, Berkeley. The material starts with an early introduction 
        to applications, well before students have built up enough theory to fully 
        analyze the applications. This motivates students to learn the theory 
        and allows students to master signals and systems at the sophomore level. 
        The material motivates signals and systems through sound and images, as 
        opposed to circuits, and as such calculus is the only prerequisite. </p>
      <p>This book has an associated <a href="../publications/lab-manual.pdf">Lab 
        Manual</a> that includes well-integrated MATLAB and Simulink labs.</p>
